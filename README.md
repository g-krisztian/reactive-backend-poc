# Reactive backend POC

The basic idea is to figure out if we can use atom's watcher to handle a subscription based backend.

Actions are key/function pairs. The handler creates an atom, and adds watchers with all function what defined in router,
and resets the atom with the content of the request.

The watchers are reacting to the changed values, calling the subscribed functions in order of route definition. The
execution results are merged back to the watched atom. Anytime a key changes in the atom, the subscribed actions are
executed. The handler reacts to the `:response` key, extracting it, and sends it back to the caller.
